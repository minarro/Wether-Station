# Wether-Station
A simple weather station demo project using the PIC18F27J53 microcontroller. Includes a full-featured library for the BME280 pressure/humidity sensor and a library for alphanumeric LCDs with improved usability compared to XLCD. Can be easily ported to other 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.
